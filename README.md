# Chocolate-Imports
## Chocolate imports to South Africa from 2010 to 2015
The chocolate imports to South Africa dataset contains the custom values and statistical quantity of the chocolate imported from different countries in the years 2010 to 2015. The data set is available from the OpenUp data portal.  OpenUp has shortened the dataset to 1000 rows, the complete dataset can be obtained from the South African Revenue Services (SARS) website, therefore this report is conducted purely to analyse the data and not to make any predictions.

The dataset consists of the name and code of the exporting country, the South African receiving port, the statistical unit and quantity of the chocolate, the customs value of the chocolate and the year and month in which the import occurred. Wikipedia defines customs valuation as a process whereby the goods or service being imported are assigned a monetary value.

I have used a number of python libraries such as pandas, NumPy to handle arrays and matrices and Matplotlib and Seaborn to create plots. The code file is created in Jupyter notebook.

The purpose of this report is to explore the change in chocolate imports to South Africa over the period of 2010 to 2015. To explore the proportion of countries and regions that import chocolate to South Africa and how that changed over the same period.  What was the most used mode of transport for chocolate imports to South Africa? What are the top importing countries of chocolate to SA?
